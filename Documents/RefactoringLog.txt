Refactoring Instance #1
- Refactored Edit.java
  - I performed some method extraction on the Edit class. the class originally consisted of two overly large methods. I broke those methods up into tasks that could be performed by other methods, and used a consistant naming system to help illustrate their functionality. The new code should now be easier to read as well as easier to change should the need arise. 
    
Refactoring Instance #2
- Refactored GUI layouts and added title page
  - Added a title page to ease navigation and refactored layouts to provide a more intuitive interface. Previously the application loaded directly into the view recipes activity and the buttons to navigate between the activitys were confusing to new users. The new title page and GUI layout improvements provide a much more intuitive and easy to use interface for users.

Refactoring Instance #3
- Refactored SortRecipes.java
  - Performed some method extraction on the SortRecipes class. The origin class consisted of several duplicate code blocks. I move those duplicate code block as two small method with meaningful name. The new code will be easier to read.
