Group Meeting 

Somebody needs to update log on Fridays meeting 

Thoughts 
- keep track of time spent on programming and update log 
- 
  
Want menu button to access three main features
  - Recipes
  - Shopping List 
  - Menus 
access functionality of each from main activity linked to menu 

Classes that need defining so far:
- one for each activity
			- View Recipe 
			- View Recipe Details 
			- Modify Recipe 
			- View Shopping List
			- Edit List Shopping 
			- View Menus 
			- Edit Menus 
			- Search Recipes 
			- Favorite Recipes 
		- recipe classes
		- ingredient class
		- database interaction class
		- Business Object Class -> class which defines all "work" methods 	
			- search methods
		- Shopping List Class 
		- Menu Class 

Recipe Class is going to consist of String ArrayLists for ingredients and instructions 
  - will change for next iteration to ingredient objects 
  
As of now, focuses solely on daily menus for Iter2.
  
for friday: Examine Vision Statement and compare to current plans

future plans: change recipe class to use ingredient objects, create ingredient class,
add ingredients to shopping list by button, create list of favorite recipes, rate recipes  
search recipes, create and view menus, ability to customize recipe based on # of people served
